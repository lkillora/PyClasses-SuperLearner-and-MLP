# SuperLearner
Two Jupyter Notebook files which create from scratch a SuperLearner Python class and an MLP Python class. The SuperLearner fits it on the MNIST fashion dataset, and the MLP fits on the letter recognition dataset. The code is really raw and is worthy of some improvements. In fact, it really is only a prototype at this point.
